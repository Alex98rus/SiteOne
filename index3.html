        <h1>TYPES OF SENTENCES</h1>

        <p>Sentences can be structurally classified into simple, compound and complex.</p>
            <p><b>1.	Simple Sentences.</b></p>
            <p>A simple sentence consists of a single main clause. They can be further subdivided into extended and unextended. A sentence which consists only of a subject and a predicate is called unextended. A sentence which has some secondary parts is called extended</p>
        <p><b>2.	Compound Sentences.</b></p>
        <p>A compound sentence consists of two or more main clauses.</p>
        <p><b>3.	Complex Sentences.</b></p>
        <p>A complex sentence consists of a principal (main, independent) clause and one or more subordinate (dependent) clauses.</p>
        <p>A complex sentence has two or more clauses, at least one of which is subordinate to a main clause. A subordinate clause is usually introduced by a subordinate conjunction or by a relative pronoun.</p>
        <p>When two clauses are combined into one sentence, a conjunction is used to connect them and indicate the relationship between them. The relations between the principal and the subordinate clauses can be different. The subordinate clauses can give the reason for what is stated in the main clause or specify something or somebody mentioned in the main clause, etc. There are three main kinds of subordinate clauses:
    </p>
        <ol>
           <li>Reported clauses;</li>
           <li>Relative clauses;</li>
           <li>Adverbial clauses.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>RELATIVE CLAUSES</h1>
        <p>Using relative clauses helps to provide additional information about someone or something. Relative clauses can be of two types: <b>identifying</b> and <b>non-identifying:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Identifying relative clauses usually come immediately after the nouns that they modify. In speech, they are not separated by pauses;</p></li>
            <li><p>Non-identifying relative clauses are normally separated by pauses in speech and commas in writing.</p></li>
        </ul></p>
