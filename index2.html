        <h2>“Modal Verbs” Section ( I.A. Svetlakov )</h2>
        <p>Learning modal verbs in 11th grade is important because they are essential for expressing ideas, thoughts, and opinions in a nuanced and sophisticated way. Modal verbs modify the meaning of other verbs, expressing ability, possibility, necessity, permission, obligation, and more.</p>
        <p>By understanding and using modal verbs correctly, students can significantly improve the clarity and precision of their writing and speech. Modal verbs also play a crucial role in academic writing, as they are often used to indicate degrees of certainty, make suggestions, offer alternatives, and convey polite requests.</p>
        <p>The creation of the website was driven by the recognition that understanding modal verbs can be difficult for English language learners, requiring consistent practice. The website is tailored for high school students at intermediate to advanced levels (B1-C1) and for individuals looking to enhance their English language skills on their own.</p>
        <p>The primary aim of the website is to offer opportunities for practicing the grammatical skill of using modal verbs in high school; to improve proficiency in using modal verbs correctly in both spoken and written communication; and to help prevent common errors in their usage.</p>
